Atomic Simulation Environment - ASE
###################################

The Atomic Simulation Environment - ASE is a set of Python based tools and 
modules for setting up, manipulating, running, visualizing and analyzing 
atomistic simulations (cf. `ASE documentation 
<https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_). 

Thanks to mutual support of socket-communication and file-IO by ASE and DFTB+, 
you can freely choose the most suitable communication type for you. Further 
information can be found in the sections linked below.

Note: Before going through the following sections, please make sure that you have 
installed a working version of the ASE package. If you are wondering how to 
`install ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/install.html>`_, please consult the 
appropriate documentation.
