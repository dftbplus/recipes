****************
Python Interface
****************

The Python interface enables DFTB calculations to be performed by external
programs. Results such as system energy, atomic forces and Mulliken charges can
be extracted directly, along with performing tasks like defining calculations in
external potentials or updating the geometry. With the pythonapi (version 0.1)
an existing input file (`dftb_in.hsd`), which contains settings in addition to
the geometry, is required for the initialization of DFTB+.

Regarding the **units**: Just like DFTB+, the interface expects and delivers
values in **atomic units**!

Setting up DFTB+
================

For this special use case, DFTB+ needs to be compiled as a shared library with
API support enabled. At this point, a basic understanding of how to build DFTB+
is assumed (all necessary steps are explained in the INSTALL.rst file in the top
level directory of the DFTB+ repository). The CMake configuration for this case
can be done by setting the WITH_PYTHON, WITH_API, ENABLE_DYNAMIC_LOADING and
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS flags to be TRUE in the file `config.cmake`, before starting
the configuration and compilation process. Alternatively, if you do not want to
modify files, a construct like the following is a convenient way to specify
these flags on the command line while configuring with CMake:

``cmake -DWITH_PYTHON=1 -DWITH_API=1 -DENABLE_DYNAMIC_LOADING=1 -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1 ..``

If only the pure compilation process is carried out, the resulting library is
located inside the build directory at `src/dftbp/`. If ``make install`` was
executed, there is also a copy placed in the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` path, which
defaults to `_install/lib/` inside the build directory. Within these locations,
the library files `libdftbplus.*` will be installed.

The path to the resulting shared library must be passed to the interface, so you
will need to know where the `libdftbplus.*` files ends up.

Setting up the interface
========================

You can install the associated Python package via the standard 'pip' mechanism,
by issuing ``python -m pip install .`` in the directory `tools/pythonapi/`, with
an appropriate level of permissions.

.. _sec-interfaces-pyapi-input:

Providing the input for DFTB+
=============================

[Input: `recipes/interfaces/pyapi/`]

To initialize an instance of the dftbplus calculator, you will need an initial
file formatted according to the HSD structure for the usual `dftb_in.hsd` input
of DFTB+.

Although the geometry of the structure to be calculated can be later replaced by
your main script, it is necessary first to supply a dummy geometry (suitable for
the desired number of atoms and boundary conditions). It is important to ensure
that the total number of coordinates matches the number of atoms of the real
geometry and that any specified lattice vectors are linearly independent,
otherwise DFTB+ will return an error message. In the case of the supplied |TiO2|
example the following geometry block of `dftb_in.hsd` would be appropriate::

    Geometry = GenFormat {

	6  S
     Ti  O
	1 1    0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00
	2 1    0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00
	3 2    0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00
	4 2    0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00
	5 2    0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00
	6 2    0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00
	0.0000000000E+00    0.0000000000E+00    0.0000000000E+00
	1.0000000000E+02    0.0000000000E+00    0.0000000000E+00
	0.0000000000E+00    1.0000000000E+02    0.0000000000E+00
	0.0000000000E+00    0.0000000000E+00    1.0000000000E+02

    }

The section ``Hamiltonian`` contains the usual entries for the calculation
of a |TiO2| supercell::

    Hamiltonian = DFTB {

      Scc = Yes
      MaxSccIterations = 100
      SccTolerance = 1.00e-05

      SlaterKosterFiles = Type2FileNames {
	Prefix = "./slakos/mio-ext/"
	Separator = "-"
	Suffix = ".skf"
      }

      MaxAngularMomentum {
	Ti = "d"
	O  = "p"
      }

      KPointsAndWeights = SupercellFolding {
	4   0   0
	0   4   0
	0   0   4
	0.5 0.5 0.5
      }

    }

To be able to also extract the forces via the interface, it is advisable to
specify the corresponding entry in the ``Analysis{}`` block. Otherwise DFTB+
will issue an error message, asking the user to do so. To ensure backwards
compatibility of the input, the parser version should also be specified::

    Analysis {
      CalculateForces = Yes
    }

    ParserOptions {
      ParserVersion = 8
    }

.. _sec-interfaces-pyapi-mainscript:

Main script
===========

The script shown here serves to illustrate the use of the Python interface,
based on the calculation of |TiO2|.

In order to be able to use the interface, the package `dftbplus` must be
imported as the first step. The path `LIB_PATH` to the DFTB+ shared library is
defined (note that the name prefix of the libray file name should also be part
of the path), as well as conversion factors to convert the atom coordinates we
will list in from Ångström into the atomic units (Bohr) required by the
interface.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import dftbplus


    LIB_PATH = '/home/user/libdftbplus'

    # DFTB+ conversion factors
    # (according to src/dftbp/common/constants.F90)
    BOHR_AA = 0.529177249
    AA_BOHR = 1 / BOHR_AA

At the beginning of the ``main()`` function, the atom coordinates and lattice
vectors are defined. In this case, a conversion to atomic units is necessary,
since a `.gen` block is used whose values are usually in units of Ångström.

.. _sec-interfaces-pyapi-codeblock1:

    def main():

	latvecs *= AA_BOHR

An object of the DftbPlus class is instantiated, which requires the location of
the shared library `libpath`, the HSD input file `hsdpath` and the name of the
log file `logfile` to be optionally specified. These keywords have default
values './libdftbplus', './dftb_in.hsd' and None if not set explicitly.  Note,
that adding the shared library extension to `libpath` is not essential.  Since
the extension can be system dependent, it is guessed by the interface if
missing. If logfile=None is specified, the output of the calculation gets
printed to stdout.

After instantiation, the geometry can set or replaced; for periodic structures,
lattice vectors can be specified in addition to the absolute coordinates.

The DFTB+ calculations are carried out automatically, as soon as the
corresponding get_* methods are called. To correctly finalize the DFTB+ object,
use the ``close()`` method.

.. _sec-interfaces-pyapi-codeblock2:

.. code-block:: python

	cdftb = dftbplus.DftbPlus(libpath=LIB_PATH,
				  hsdpath='dftb_in.hsd',

	# get number of atoms

To do so, follow the path mentioned above.

The Interface is also capable of defining a population (in)dependent external
potential. This is covered in the following two sections
(:ref:`extpot <sec-interfaces-pyapi-extpot>`,
:ref:`qdepextpot <sec-interfaces-pyapi-qdepextpot>`).

.. _sec-interfaces-pyapi-extpot:

Using a population independent external potential
=================================================

[Input: `recipes/interfaces/pyapi/extpot/`]

A external potential which does not depend on the Mulliken charges in the
calculation can be included with only a small addition in the script. The DFTB+
object has a method ``set_external_potential()``, which should be relatively
self-explanatory. The external potential at the position of the QM-atoms is
given as a positional argument. If forces are required, the gradient of the
external potential at each atom can be passed additionally as the keyword
argument `extpotgrad`.

Therefore, after the initialization of the DFTB+ object, the following code is
inserted:

.. code-block:: python

    # example values of extpot and extpotgrad used here were
    # taken from file: test/api/mm/testers/test_extpot.f90
    extpot = np.array([-0.025850198503435,
                       -0.005996294763958,
                       -0.022919371690684])

    extpotgrad = np.array([
        [0.035702717378527,  0.011677956375860, 0.009766745155626],
        [0.023243271928971, -0.000046945156575, 0.004850533043745],
        [0.016384005706180,  0.004608295375551, 0.005401080774962]])

    # set external potential and its gradients
    cdftb.set_external_potential(extpot, extpotgrad=extpotgrad)

.. _sec-interfaces-pyapi-qdepextpot:

Population dependent external potential
=======================================

[Input: `recipes/interfaces/pyapi/qdepextpot/`]

This section deals with the capability of the interface to run calculations with
a population dependent external potential, i.e. arrising in cases like
polarizable surroundings where the applied field responds to the state of the QM
calculation. Since in general only the user knows how to calculate this type of
potential, callback functions can be defined which will then be executed at
runtime.

The DFTB+ object provides a method ``register_ext_pot_generator()`` that takes
care of the registration of the callback functions. As the first positional
argument of this method, an arbitrary pointer can be specified. DFTB+ will pass
back this pointer unaltered when calling the registered functions. You can
typically use it to pass a pointer to the data or a Python object (class) which
contains the necessary data for the potential calculation. If your data is in
the global space and you do not need it, pass None (or equivalent). The second
and third positional arguments have to be the function that provides the
external potential and its gradients.

Furthermore, the auxiliary class ``PotentialCalculator`` is defined to perform
the actual calculation of the external potential and its gradients. The
structure of a script required for the calculation is explained below, using a
trivial example in which the external potential and gradient are assumed to be
zero. Therefore, this should not change the results of the calculation.

The initialization of the calculator and the definition of the geometry is
completely analogous to the

registration of the callback functions is still missing:

    cdftb.register_ext_pot_generator(potcalc, get_extpot, get_extpotgrad)
