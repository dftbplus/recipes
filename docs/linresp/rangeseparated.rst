Calculations using range-separated TD-DFTB
******************************************

In DFT there are a variety of exchange-correlation functionals, for
example the local density approximation (LDA) or various gradient
corrected functionals (GGA). Functionals that mix pure DFT and HF,
so-called hybrid functionals are widely used in chemistry and
physics. A new member of the club are the range-separated (or
long-range corrected) functionals that combine pure DFT for short
electron-electron distance with HF at longer distance. Conventional
DFTB is based on the GGA, while ground and excited state calculations
for range-separated functionals are now also available in *DFTB+*. The
corresponding method is named LC-DFTB.


You will need a recent version of DFTB+ (>= 21) to perform the
calculations in this section.

Benzene-Tetracyanoethylene dimer (TD-DFTB)
==========================================



[Input: `recipes/linresp/range-separated/td-dftb`]

Let us first do a conventional TD-DFTB calculation for the dimer of
tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and a benzene molecule to show the
difference between both approaches. Here is the relevant part of the
input::

  Hamiltonian = DFTB {
      SCC = Yes
      SCCTolerance = 1.0E-10
      MaxAngularMomentum = {
         N = "p"
         C = "p"
	 H = "s"
      }
      SlaterKosterFiles = Type2FileNames {
          Prefix = "../../../slakos/download/mio/mio-1-1/"
          Separator = "-"
          Suffix = ".skf"
      }
  }

  ExcitedState {
      Casida {
          NrOfExcitations = 10
          Symmetry = Singlet
    	  Diagonaliser = Stratmann {SubSpaceFactor = 30}
      }
  }

We are loading here the `mio` Slater-Koster files, which have been
generated using the GGA functional PBE. Note the new entry
``Diagonalizer`` in the Casida block. Besides the default ``Arpack``
diagonalizer also the ``Stratmann`` algorithm may be used for the
diagonalization of the response matrix. For small systems like the
present one, the ``Stratmann`` option is very often faster.

The output in EXC.DAT looks like follows::

       w [eV]       Osc.Str.         Transition         Weight      KS [eV]    Sym.

      4.570        0.00000000        31   ->    38        1.000       4.570      S
      4.573        0.00000000        30   ->    38        1.000       4.573      S
      4.881        0.00000000        29   ->    38        1.000       4.881      S
      4.897        0.00000000        28   ->    38        1.000       4.897      S

The lowest excited state at 2.033 eV corresponds to the HOMO->LUMO
transition. We can visualize these orbitals using `waveplot` (see
:ref:`sec-basics-waveplot`) to obtain more information on the nature
of this state (:numref:`fig_dimer_homo` and :numref:`fig_dimer_lumo`).

  .. _fig_dimer_homo:
  .. figure:: /_figures/linresp/homo.png
     :height: 36ex
     :align: center
     :alt: homo real

     Highest occupied molecular orbital (orbital index 37) of the
     TCNE-Benzene dimer

  .. _fig_dimer_lumo:
  .. figure:: /_figures/linresp/lumo.png
     :height: 36ex
     :align: center
     :alt: lumo real

     Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (orbital index 38) of the
     TCNE-Benzene dimer
    
We see that the lowest excited state is of charge transfer type, in
which an electron is excited from the donor (benzene) to the acceptor
(TCNE). TD-DFT using GGA functionals typically strongly underestimates
such states, and this is also the case for TD-DFTB.

Benzene-Tetracyanoethylene dimer (TD-LC-DFTB)
=============================================

[Input: `recipes/linresp/range-separated/td-lc-dftb`] 

We now repeat the calculation using the TD-LC-DFTB method. The input
looks like this::

  Geometry = GenFormat {
      <<< "in.gen"
  }

  Driver = {}

  Hamiltonian = DFTB {
    
      SCC = Yes
      SCCTolerance = 1.0E-10
      MaxAngularMomentum = {
          N = "p"
          C = "p"
	  H = "s"
      }
      SlaterKosterFiles = Type2FileNames {
          Prefix = "../../../slakos/download/ob2/ob2-1-1/shift/"
          Separator = "-"
          Suffix = ".skf"
      }
      RangeSeparated = LC {
          Screening = MatrixBased {}
      }
  }

  ExcitedState {
      Casida {
          NrOfExcitations = 10
          Symmetry = Singlet
	  Diagonaliser = Stratmann {SubSpaceFactor = 30}
      }
  }
 
TD-LC-DFTB requires special Slater-Koster files that have been
generated for range-separated functionals. We are loading the `ob2`
set here. The block ``RangeSeparated`` invokes the LC-DFTB method for
the ground state. Several algorithms to speed up the calculation are
available (see manual), we are choosing the ``MatrixBased`` algorithm
here which involves no approximations. The ``ExcitedState`` section
requires no changes, although the ``Stratmann`` diagonalizer is
mandatory for TD-LC-DFTB. As you will recognize, the calculation is
slower than the previous TD-DFTB job. You can play with the parameter
``SubSpaceFactor`` (c.f. manual) to see the influence on the execution
time.

Let us now investigate the output (EXC.DAT) of the job::

      w [eV]       Osc.Str.         Transition         Weight      KS [eV]    Sym.
 
    ================================================================================
 
      4.287        0.00000000        37   ->    38        1.000       6.748      S
      4.290        0.00000013        36   ->    38        1.000       6.751      S
      4.930        0.51883432        33   ->    38        1.000       7.719      S
      4.962        0.00000101        35   ->    38        1.000       7.389      S
      4.963        0.00000002        34   ->    38        1.000       7.391      S
      5.257        0.00000000        32   ->    38        1.000       9.063      S
      5.263        0.00000000        29   ->    38        1.000       9.117      S
      5.595        0.00000000        28   ->    38        1.000       9.377      S
      5.860        0.00000000        27   ->    38        1.000       9.646      S
      6.018        0.00000000        24   ->    38        0.999       9.790      S

The lowest excited state is shifted from 2.033 eV (TD-DFTB) to 4.287
eV (TD-LC-DFTB). If you visualize the relevant molecular orbitals with
waveplot, you can verify that the nature of the state is indeed
unchanged, but the severe underestimation is corrected!
