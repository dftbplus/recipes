Introduction

These worked examples use the quantum mechanical atomistic software DFTB+ which
is available from `github <http://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus>`_. Compiled
versions of the code are also available from the `DFTB+ website
<http://www.dftbplus.org/>`_.

These recipes also require the `mio` and `tiorg` Slater-Koster data sets which
are available from `dftb.org <http://www.dftb.org>`_. The conversion scripts
from the `dptools` package, which can included with DFTB+ (and can also be
obtained from the `DFTB+ website`_), are also useful.
